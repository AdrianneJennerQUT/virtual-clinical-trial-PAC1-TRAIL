Figure 2:
To generate a distribution of virtual patients set a total number of virtual patients num_patients and run the function VP=GeneratingPatients(num_patients). 
This will given a matrix num_patients x 5 matrix VP where each row is an individual virtual patients 5 parameters: Vd_PAC1, CL_PAC1, Vd_TRAIL, CL_TRAIL, BW. 

Figure 3: 
To generate an initial simulation of the model for the virtual patients under a single injection of PAC-1 and TRAIL run commands_initialpatientmodelbehaviour.m

Figure 4:
To determine each individual virtual patient's optimal treatment of PAC-1 and TRAIL run commands_optimizer.m

Figure 5: 
To investigate the characteristics of the new sub cohorts run the code commands_cohort1vscohort2.m

Figure 6: 
To create a population of new virtual cohorts based on the sub cohorts identified in Figure 5, used commands_creatingnewcohorts.m. To then determine protocols that are optimal for all individuals in the sub cohorts run commands_subcohortoptimal.m
